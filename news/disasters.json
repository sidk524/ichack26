      "description": "\n                            <div class=\"tag country\">Country: Mexico</div>\n                                      <div class=\"tag source\">Source: International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies</div>\n                                                                                                                <p>This is an adaptation of the original article written by Brenda Ávila Flores, Francisco Gabriel Reyes Gil, Jessica Rosales, Karla Hernandez, and Daniela Aguilar, published on December 15, 2025.</p>\n<p>Mexico is vulnerable to a variety of climate-related risks. These include droughts in the northern desert region, frosts in the north-west and north-east, heavy rainfall in the south, and tropical cyclones along the coast.</p>\n<p>According to Mexico’s National Centre for Disaster Prevention, approximately 80 per cent of disaster-related costs in Mexico between 2000 and 2022 were associated with water-related events.</p>\n<p>Flooding in the country has consistently caused damage to infrastructure, loss of life, displacement of communities and economic losses.</p>\n<p>Heat waves are also common in Mexico during the summer; however, the National Water Commission reports that most of the country has experienced above-average temperatures due to climate change.</p>\n<p>Two contrasting locations are Mexicali and Veracruz (Sotavento). These locations differ widely in terms of their geography, the threats they face, their vulnerabilities and their capacities.</p>\n<p>Mexicali is an urban centre on the northern border where people work in agriculture, industry and services, but face extreme heat, scarce rainfall and limited cooling options.</p>\n<p>In contrast, peri-urban and rural communities in the Sotavento region depend on agriculture, experience abundant rainfall and have access to river systems. However, they are constantly exposed to flooding and tropical cyclones.</p>\n<h2><strong>Climate Resilience Measurement for Communities</strong></h2>\n<p>In recent months, the Mexican Red Cross has used the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://zcralliance.org/crmc/\"><strong>Climate Resilience Measurement for Communities (CRMC)</strong></a> framework to guide a holistic and participatory process. The CRMC is a data-driven process that help communities evaluate and measure their resilience to climate hazards. And then, using the results, they can identify and implement resilience-building interventions and run additional measurements to track improvements.</p>\n<p>This measurement process included people's concerns about flooding in Veracruz communities, as well as the health implications of heat-related vector-borne diseases in Mexicali.</p>\n<p>The framework enables context-specific information on climate resilience to be obtained. By linking local knowledge with regional action, the Mexican Red Cross and its partners are addressing the immediate risks of extreme heat and flooding while also shaping systemic solutions for Mexico's future.</p>\n<p>The programme works with local populations to strengthen flood resilience at household and community levels by implementing interventions such as forming community brigades, developing family emergency plans and raising risk awareness through community resilience fairs.</p>\n<p>In both rural and urban areas, the Mexican Red Cross facilitates collaboration and integration with various sectors, including health, education, universities, and civil protection. This knowledge and experience is shared with communities, professionals, and political leaders, and is used to promote better laws, policies, and plans.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heat waves</strong></h3>\n<p>In recent years, Mexicali has experienced record temperatures in summer and an increasing number of heat waves. In 2024 alone, 47 deaths were directly attributed to extreme heat, marking a notable rise compared to previous years. This trend highlights the urgent need to address extreme heat as a critical public health issue.</p>\n<p>In Mexicali, families and workers depend on improved infrastructure and protective equipment, such as air conditioning, thermally insulated buildings and public cooling centres. This is not only to safeguard their health, but also to maintain their livelihoods and economic activities.</p>\n<p>However, air conditioning is not accessible to all, and marginalised communities often experience power outages, which increases their vulnerability. This highlights the need to explore affordable, accessible alternative cooling solutions to ensure heat protection for the most vulnerable.</p>\n<p>The assessment conducted through the CRMC identified opportunities to improve understanding of, and implementation of, Nature-Based Solutions (NbS), which protect, manage and restore ecosystems in order to address climate challenges.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>“There is no single approach to increasing climate resilience”.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Mexican Red Cross Resilience Programme Team</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4><strong>Hurricanes and storms</strong></h4>\n<p>The municipalities of the Sotavento region in Veracruz are regularly affected by hurricanes and tropical cyclones. These events bring heavy rainfall, which causes flooding in the basin and in low-lying areas.</p>\n<p>A key factor in the region's resilience is the presence of community brigades: local groups trained in disaster preparedness and response. The CRMC analysis identified an opportunity to strengthen these brigades by providing them with training and coordination, and by linking them to Early Warning Systems (EWS), which currently have limited reach at the local level. This will ensure that the most vulnerable groups receive timely information that will prompt life-saving actions and reduce losses and damage.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>“While each community has its own particular circumstances, the CRMC's research in multiple communities reveals trends in the impact of floods and extreme heat on social and economic structures”.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Mexican Red Cross Resilience Programme Team</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>A collaborative approach</strong></p>\n<p>The CRMC process generates localised, up-to-date information that provides valuable insight into both gaps and opportunities.</p>\n<p>The Mexican Red Cross uses these findings to design and implement resilience actions that address real needs while strengthening existing capacities. Guided by the programme's objectives, the Mexican Red Cross works to integrate climate resilience with disaster risk management and expand access to SAT for floods and heat among the most vulnerable populations.</p>\n<p>These findings emphasise the importance of promoting context-specific resilience measures and influencing local and regional stakeholders to address shared challenges.</p>\n<p>In implementing the CRMC, the Mexican Red Cross adopted an innovative approach to data collection, adapted to urban contexts and designed to protect staff and volunteers in complex environments.</p>\n<p>Rather than conducting door-to-door surveys, resilience fairs were organised in Mexicali and Veracruz. These events brought community members together to participate actively in measuring the CRMC and in interactive activities designed to raise awareness of the risks in their territories.</p>\n<p>Additionally, data was collected through focus groups and interviews with key stakeholders. These included community leaders and government authorities from various civil protection organisations.</p>\n<p>This timely engagement enabled critical stakeholders and potential partners to become involved from the outset, thereby building trust and credibility.</p>\n<p>This engagement continues today as the Mexican Red Cross communicates the main results of the CRMC to decision-makers and communities, strengthening shared responsibility, empowering local actors to lead resilience efforts and ensuring that actions are appropriated by those most affected.</p>\n<p>To complement the actions of the Mexican Red Cross at a local level, the IFRC will work to ensure that the lessons learned from this initiative are recognised, adopted and replicated internationally in various strategic areas.</p>\n              \n      \n      ",

The accounts shared by survivors highlight the extreme lengths to which families with children are forced to go to escape conflict, disaster and persecution.</p>\n<p><strong>IRC Italy staff member working at the disembarkation points in Lampedusa recalls:</strong></p>\n<p>“On Thursday evening, I was at the dock. The vessel arrived around 19:30. As soon as one man disembarked, he appeared confused and was shouting. He was transported on a stretcher to the emergency room, where he later passed away.</p>\n<p>“The following day, we met the mother of the missing twins. She was crying desperately, screaming, and appeared to be in a state of shock. […] When she saw two other Guinean women holding their children, she broke down crying and started screaming again.</p>\n<p>“We have spoken with other people from Cameroon and Guinea who had been on the same boat. Some reported that the twins had died from the cold during the crossing; however, this information remains vague and unverified.”</p>\n<p>In 2025 alone, at least 1,340 people lost their lives in the Central Mediterranean, with hundreds more reported missing at sea or confirmed dead in just the first month of 2026, following the incidents reported in recent days.</p>\n<p><strong>“Nobody puts their child on a boat unless they have absolutely no other choice,” adds Marta Welander, EU Advocacy Director with the IRC.</strong></p>\n<p>“The events of last week, and the tragic accounts shared by survivors in Italy, underscore more than ever the need for humanitarian leadership in Europe. This will require expanding and creating more safe routes to protection, such as refugee resettlement, so that people are not forced to risk their lives on these deadly journeys in the first place.</p>\n<p>“Europe must prioritise the wellbeing, rights and dignity of people seeking safety, and work towards a truly humane, effective and sustainable asylum and migration system.”</p>\n<p><strong>Media contacts</strong></p>\n<p>Joanna Nahorska</p>\n<p>+32 474 160 470</p>\n<p><strong>joanna.nahorska@rescue.org</strong></p>\n<p>IRC Global Communications</p>\n<p><strong>communications@rescue.org</strong></p>\n              \n      \n      ",

Many returnees from Iran and Pakistan are living in informal shelters, camps, or overcrowded conditions, and are among those most exposed to the impact of the storms.</p>\n<p>The situation has been worsened by recurrent disasters, climate shocks, aid cuts, and a collapsing economy, leaving millions of people across the country living in poverty and highly vulnerable to extreme weather.</p>\n<p>The CARE teams are closely monitoring the situation and coordinating with local partners to assess urgent humanitarian needs, particularly in remote and hard-to-reach areas, where access remains constrained due to blocked roads and ongoing severe weather conditions.</p>\n<p>“Our hearts and minds are with the families who have lost loved ones,” said <strong>Kristina Jovanovska, Deputy Country Director, CARE Afghanistan</strong>. “These snowstorms have added to the immense challenges already facing millions of people across Afghanistan. Communities have not yet recovered from last year’s devastating earthquake, and now severe winter weather has further deepened their hardship. Women and girls are bearing the disproportionate impact of these recurring disasters, facing heightened risks<br>\nand vulnerabilities. With homes damaged or destroyed, families are struggling to stay warm and safe as temperatures remain dangerously low. Immediate assistance is critical to prevent further loss of life.”</p>\n<p>CARE is exploring options to scale up emergency assistance as access allows, with a focus on winterization support, emergency shelter, and protection for the most vulnerable households. CARE is also engaging with humanitarian coordination mechanisms to support a timely and effective response.</p>\n<p><strong>For media inquiries</strong>, please email usa.media@care.org, or contact <strong>Muhammad Mudabbir Maajid, CARE’s Regional Communications Advisor for Asia</strong>, mudabbir.maajid@care.org</p>\n              \n      \n      ",

Estas localidades difieren ampliamente en geografía, amenazas, vulnerabilidades y capacidades.</p>\n<p><strong>Mexicali</strong> es un centro urbano en la frontera norte, donde la gente se dedica a la agricultura, la industria y los servicios, pero enfrenta calor extremo, lluvias escasas y opciones limitadas de enfriamiento.</p>\n<p>Por otro lado, las comunidades periurbanas y rurales de la región del <strong>Sotavento</strong> dependen de la agricultura, y presentan abundantes lluvias y sistemas fluviales, con una exposición constante a inundaciones y ciclones tropicales.</p>\n<p>Las autoridades locales de protección civil responden a un cuestionario como parte del proceso de medición de la resiliencia climática de las comunidades en Jamapa, Veracruz, México.</p>\n<p>Foto: Cruz Roja Mexicana</p>\n<h2><strong>Medición de la Resiliencia Climática para Comunidades</strong></h2>\n<p>En los últimos meses, la Cruz Roja Mexicana ha utilizado el marco de <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://zcralliance.org/crmc/\">Medición de la Resiliencia Climática para las Comunidades (CRMC)</a> para guiar un proceso holístico y participativo. La CRMC es un proceso basado en datos que ayuda a las comunidades a evaluar y medir su resiliencia ante los peligros climáticos. A partir de los resultados, pueden identificar y aplicar intervenciones para fortalecer la resiliencia y realizar mediciones adicionales para hacer un seguimiento de las mejoras.</p>\n<p>Este proceso de medición incluyó las preocupaciones de la población sobre las inundaciones en las comunidades de Veracruz, así como las implicaciones para la salud de las enfermedades transmitidas por vectores relacionadas con el calor en Mexicali.</p>\n<p>Este marco permite obtener información específica de cada contexto sobre la resiliencia climática. Al vincular los conocimientos locales con la acción regional, la Cruz Roja Mexicana y sus socios no solo están abordando los riesgos inmediatos de calor extremo e inundaciones, sino que también le están dando forma a soluciones sistémicas para el futuro de México.</p>\n<p>El programa trabaja con las poblaciones locales para fortalecer la resiliencia ante las inundaciones a nivel doméstico y comunitario, implementando intervenciones como la formación de brigadas comunitarias, el desarrollo de planes de emergencia familiares y la sensibilización sobre los riesgos a través de ferias comunitarias sobre resiliencia.</p>\n<p>Tanto en contextos rurales como urbanos, la Cruz Roja Mexicana facilita la integración y la colaboración con diversos sectores, entre ellos la salud, la educación, las universidades y la protección civil. Los conocimientos y la experiencia adquiridos se comparten con las comunidades, los profesionales y los liderazgos políticos, y se utilizan como base para promover mejores leyes, políticas y planes.</p>\n<p>Un hombre en Baja California, México, llena una botella de plástico en un punto de hidratación durante un día caluroso y seco en la Plaza del Mariachi, en Mexicali.</p>\n<p>Foto: Cruz Roja Mexicana</p>\n<h3><strong>Olas de calor</strong></h3>\n<p>En los últimos años, <strong>Mexicali</strong> ha enfrentado temperaturas récord durante el verano y olas de calor cada vez más frecuentes. Solo en 2024, se reportaron 47 muertes directamente relacionadas con el calor extremo, lo que representa un aumento significativo en comparación con años anteriores. Esta tendencia subraya que el calor extremo es un problema crítico de salud pública.</p>\n<p>Las familias y trabajadores en Mexicali dependen de infraestructura mejorada y de equipos de protección como aire acondicionado, edificios con aislamiento térmico y centros públicos de enfriamiento, no solo para salvaguardar su salud, sino también para mantener sus medios de vida y actividades económicas.</p>\n<p>Sin embargo, el aire acondicionado está lejos de ser accesible para todas las personas y las comunidades marginadas suelen enfrentar fallas en el suministro eléctrico, lo que incrementa su vulnerabilidad. Esto destacó la necesidad de explorar soluciones alternativas de enfriamiento que sean asequibles y accesibles, garantizando protección ante el calor para quienes corren más riesgo.</p>\n<p>La evaluación realizada a través de la CRMC permitió identificar oportunidades para mejorar la comprensión y la implementación de Soluciones basadas en la Naturaleza (SbN), las cuales protegen, gestionan y restauran ecosistemas para enfrentar los desafíos climáticos.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"No existe un enfoque único para incrementar la resiliencia climática\".</em></p>\n<p>Equipo del Programa de Resiliencia de la Cruz Roja Mexicana</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4><strong>Huracanes y tormentas</strong></h4>\n<p>En <strong>Veracruz</strong>, los municipios de la región de Sotavento son afectados regularmente por huracanes y ciclones tropicales. Estos eventos traen consigo lluvias intensas que provocan inundaciones tanto en la cuenca como en zonas bajas.</p>\n<p>Una fortaleza clave de resiliencia en la región es la presencia de brigadas comunitarias, grupos locales capacitados para liderar la preparación y respuesta ante desastres. El análisis de la CRMC identificó una oportunidad para fortalecer estas brigadas mediante la capacitación y coordinación, además de vincularlas con los Sistemas de Alerta Temprana (SAT) —que actualmente tienen un alcance limitado a nivel local— para asegurar que los grupos en condiciones más vulnerables reciban información oportuna que impulse acciones que salvan vidas y reduzcan pérdidas y daños.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“Aunque cada comunidad presenta un contexto único, los resultados de la CRMC en múltiples comunidades revelan tendencias sobre cómo las inundaciones y el calor extremo afectan las estructuras sociales y económicas\".</em></p>\n<p>Equipo del Programa de Resiliencia de la Cruz Roja Mexicana</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5><strong>Un enfoque colaborativo</strong></h5>\n<p>La información localizada y actualizada generada por el proceso de la CRMC proporciona una comprensión valiosa tanto de brechas como de oportunidades.</p>\n<p>La Cruz Roja Mexicana aprovecha estos hallazgos para diseñar e implementar acciones de resiliencia que respondan a necesidades reales mientras se fortalecen las capacidades existentes. Guiándose por los objetivos del programa, trabaja en la integración de la resiliencia climática con la gestión del riesgo de desastres y la ampliación del acceso a SAT para inundaciones y calor entre las poblaciones en condiciones más vulnerables.</p>\n<p>Estos hallazgos destacan el valor de impulsar acciones de resiliencia específicas para cada contexto, al mismo tiempo que se influye en actores locales o regionales para buscar soluciones ante los desafíos compartidos.</p>\n<p>Para la implementación de la CRMC, la Cruz Roja Mexicana adoptó un enfoque innovador de recolección de datos, adaptado a contextos urbanos y diseñado para proteger al personal y al voluntariado en entornos complejos.</p>\n<p>En lugar de realizar encuestas casa por casa, se organizaron ferias de resiliencia en Mexicali y Veracruz. Estos espacios reunieron a miembros de la comunidad para participar activamente en la medición de la CRMC y en actividades interactivas de sensibilización sobre los riesgos en sus territorios.</p>\n<p>De forma complementaria, se recopilaron datos a través de grupos focales y entrevistas con actores clave. Entre ellos, líderes comunitarios y autoridades gubernamentales de distintos niveles de protección civil.</p>\n<p>Esta vinculación oportuna permitió involucrar desde el inicio a actores críticos y posibles socios, generando confianza y credibilidad.</p>\n<p>Hoy, esta vinculación continúa mientras la Cruz Roja Mexicana comunica los principales resultados de la CRMC a tomadores de decisiones y comunidades para fortalecer la responsabilidad compartida, empoderar a actores locales para liderar los esfuerzos de resiliencia y asegurar que las acciones sean reapropiadas por quienes se ven más afectados.</p>\n<p>En complemento a las acciones de la Cruz Roja Mexicana a nivel local, la IFRC trabajará para que los aprendizajes obtenidos de esta iniciativa puedan ser reconocidos, adoptados y replicados a nivel internacional, en distintos espacios estratégicos.</p>\n              \n      \n      ",

The group has also focused on resupplying its forces during the difficult rainy season, particularly on the coast, where it retains some freedom of movement by boat. Elsewhere, an attack on a gold mine in Niassa, along with actions by a criminal group in Metuge pretending to be insurgents, illustrate the increasingly complex environment in which security forces have to operate.</p>\n<h2>Situation summary</h2>\n<h3>RDF and ISM clash in Macomia</h3>\n<p>According to the Islamic State’s (IS) weekly al-Naba newsletter, insurgents attacked Rwandan positions at Mucojo and Pangane in Macomia district with mortars on 18 and 19 January. IS did not claim casualties. However, according to a local source, at least one mortar landed on a civilian compound in Pangane on 18 January, killing one person and injuring another. Another source in the area claimed the attack caused multiple civilian casualties. There were no reports of casualties from the attack on the Mucojo position.</p>\n<p>The mortar attacks continue an emerging trend of insurgents attacking Rwandan forces. Locally, the attack by the insurgents is thought to be in response to Rwanda Defence Force (RDF) attempts to regain control of Quiterajo. Macomia District Administrator <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://opais.co.mz/terrorismo-em-cabo-delgado-quiterajo-continua-fora-do-controlo-do-estado/\">Tomás Badae admitted</a> earlier in the month that the Quiterajo area was the only part of the district not under government control.</p>\n<p>ISM has had mortars since at least late 2022. In a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.zitamar.com/analysis-is-m-propaganda-highlights-insurgents-own-deficiencies/\">training video</a> released in January 2023 the group displayed drills with mortars, several of which appeared to be incomplete and poorly handled. This may explain how civilians became the unwitting target in Pangane.</p>\n<p>ISM’s use of IEDs continues. On 9 January, a Rwandan military vehicle escorting a commercial convoy was hit by an IED on the N380 near Chitunda, between Macomia and Awasse. This is at least the fourth time that ISM has successfully deployed an IED in the past three months, two of which have been against the RDF.</p>\n<h3>Coastal communities at risk as ISM resupplies</h3>\n<p>Coastal communities have once again been victims of ISM’s attempts to resupply its fighters as the group continues to move freely along the coast. On 12 January, ISM militants came to the Loque settlement, close to Olumbi on the Palma coast. They were returning boats they had used to take supplies they had seized earlier in the month. According to local sources, after leaving Olumbi they encountered fishers from Pangane at sea and took them and their boats. The men — numbering 27, according to one source — were released on 18 January further down the coast, some south of Mocímboa da Praia, and others at Pangane further south again in Macomia district.</p>\n<p>ISM militants were again active on the Palma coastline. Local sources recounted how the insurgents came to Olumbi on 22 January looking for food before taking again to the sea and seeking supplies on Quifuqui island. Olumbi is approximately 20 kilometers south of the proposed liquefied natural gas plant, while Quifuqui is a further 20 km southward.</p>\n<h3>ISM enters Mocímboa da Praia once again</h3>\n<p>While one ISM group was moving at sea on 23 January, another entered Mocímboa da Praia. The group came to the Namaik area in the southeast of the town. According to local sources, they were looking for a specific person. When they could not find their primary target, they kidnapped someone else, one source alleged. This is the first confirmed incursion into the town since 5 November 2025, when ISM militants <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://acleddata.com/update/mozambique-conflict-monitor-update-12-november-2025\">took the children</a> of ISM leader Farido. As in all recent incursions, ISM fighters entered the town from the southeast. These repeated incursions suggest they have likely maintained a presence southeast of the town toward the coast, despite clashing with Rwandan forces near Nabaje in that area as recently as 21 December.</p>\n<h3>Unidentified armed group attacks Niassa gold mine</h3>\n<p>On 15 January, an unidentified armed group attacked a small-scale gold mine in Niassa province’s Marrupa district, killing one man and injuring three others. The victim, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid04bRQiAqaaviYHQtYSusibMeYjminVifru87vVXwUhVu5TtuqFnA2iTzUYeYMASHCl&amp;id=61566040604285&amp;__cft__%5B0%5D=AZZsCEu5arn59G77gA-UGnlVXnBLFqs3WNFPtwRN4wjO3RlWMJZpW6k6jQIogjAAH6QU4wlf9HjHGnf8hzL_J8yISmT5z4soWxc3a8UMiy381-YEPpTkbaBfRq9nH5HuXrRXSuAMczfbLwngMgLze5mlQzB1Un5XpwpexpkweGuZ_Q&amp;__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R\">Ckota Almeida</a>, was a well-known musician in Niassa. The mine site, known as Rereco or Lureco, is likely to the west of Marrupa district headquarters. Though the attackers were likely criminals, the incident illustrates the insecurity that sometimes accompanies small-scale and artisanal mining.</p>\n<h2>Focus: Gold mine attack highlights generalized insecurity</h2>\n<p>The attack in the Rereco gold mining area, though likely criminal, exposes the extent of the security challenge facing both communities and the security forces. This is becoming more pronounced as “<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.zitamar.com/gold-fever/\">gold fever</a>,” driven by rising gold prices internationally, has seen small-scale and artisanal mining grow considerably over the past year. This expansion is often marked by violence. In Sofala province in November, miners <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rm.co.mz/sofala-mineradores-artesanais-em-gorongosa-invadem-machambas-a-procura-de-ouro/\">clashed with farmers</a> after encroaching on their land. More recently, in Nampula’s Mogovolas province, a local civil society organization <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://opais.co.mz/koxukhuro-diz-que-confrontos-entre-policias-e-garimpeiros-resultaram-em-38-mortos-em-mogovolas/\">claims</a> that police killed up to 38 people in an operation against small-scale miners. ISM has also seen the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://acleddata.com/report/ransom-gold-and-spoils-war-islamic-state-mozambiques-new-cash-flow\">potential in the sector</a>, targeting small-scale gold and gemstone mining operations as a source of funding. Extortion payments to ISM can safeguard against an insurgent attack, while the group’s presence likely acts as a deterrent to the type of criminal gang that attacked Rereco.</p>\n<p>In this context, it is perhaps surprising that it has taken so long for criminals disguised as insurgents to emerge. In the week of 19 January, police in Metuge district <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.correiodamanhacanada.com/mocambique-ataques-grupo-simula-ser-terrorista-para-saquear-aldeia-em-cabo-delgado-policia/\">arrested</a> five young men for staging attacks on villages in the guise of Islamist insurgents. According to one report, at the village of Namaruha/Namarrau, the young men entered declaring “Allahu akbar” (“God is great”), prompting villagers to flee, and allowing them access to their homes.</p>\n<p>Namaruha lies 3 km south of the N1 highway, close to Impire village in Murrebue administrative post. ISM attacks in the area are relatively rare, though militants often cross the N1 close to Impire on sorties south. While police action in arresting the group was effective, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/miramartv.mz/posts/pfbid0o1Go3hxz4J2yjkoWdJQyW3uvsDxWLzUhjQA4UThQZNwS6htxGRejv9XQSXjH2AD7l\">online commenters</a> wondered how they can have such success against fake insurgents, and not the real thing.</p>\n<h2>Roundup</h2>\n<h3>PRM and SERNIC in standoff over arrest warrants</h3>\n<p>On 21 January, the National Criminal Investigation Service (SERNIC) moved to execute court-issued arrest warrants against several Police of the Republic of Mozambique (PRM) officers, including special operations officers (GOE), who are linked to an ongoing criminal investigation into the killing of SERNIC agent João Paulo, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://integritymagazine.co.mz/arquivos/55149\">killed</a> by gunmen on 3 July. Reports <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://4vesreportermoz.com/ultima-hora-sernic-cerca-comando-provincial-da-matola-para-deter-agente-do-goeo/\">indicated</a> that the PRM provincial command in Matola was attempting to shield the GOE officers, who were said to have sought refuge on the command's premises after being pursued. In response, SERNIC officers reportedly remained outside, maintaining pressure and demanding that the suspects be handed over. However, both the PRM and the SERNIC later <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://integritymagazine.co.mz/arquivos/56388?amp=1\">denied</a> that there had been any siege or confrontation, insisting that the operation had been coordinated and based on cooperation to enforce the law.</p>\n<h3>Floods affect nearly 700,000 people across southern Mozambique</h3>\n<p>According to national disaster authorities, severe flooding triggered by heavy rains since early January have <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rtp.pt/noticias/mundo/cheias-ja-afetaram-700-mil-mocambicanos-com-105-mil-em-centros-de-abrigo_n1713016\">affected</a> nearly 700,000 people (around 151,900 families) across southern Mozambique. Over 103,000 people have been displaced and are currently staying in more than 100 shelters. Since the start of the rainy season in October, including the most recent flooding, at least 124 people have been killed and 148 injured nationwide. The floods have caused extensive damage to housing, schools, health facilities, roads, and agricultural land. From 7 January alone, the authorities have reported damage to 229 health units, 366 schools, four bridges, and over 1,300 km of roads.</p>\n<h3>National Human Rights Commission reports no evidence of rights violations linked to Mozambique LNG</h3>\n<p>Mozambique’s National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.dw.com/pt-002/direitos-humanos-em-mo%C3%A7ambique-sem-evid%C3%AAncias-de-viola%C3%A7%C3%B5es-em-megaprojeto-de-g%C3%A1s/a-75655783\">says</a> it has so far found no evidence of human rights violations connected to the Mozambique LNG project in Cabo Delgado led by TotalEnergies, according to statements by CNDH chair Albachir Macassar to Lusa. He said investigators had gathered testimonies but had been unable to identify or locate individuals allegedly involved in, or affected by, the reported abuses — including claims that 26 people escaped torture. The commission stressed that the investigation that started in June last year remains ongoing.</p>\n              \n      \n      ",

The crisis had led to increased vulnerability, poverty, and destitution among a significant portion of the population. In 2021, 2.4 million people fell below the international poverty line for lower-middle-income countries, with more poor households losing over half of their income. This resulted in people selling assets, becoming indebted, and cutting down on food, and their children were less likely to attend school. An estimated 5.7 million people were in need of humanitarian assistance, with at least 4.9 million were being food insecure.3 The crisis had disproportionately affected vulnerable populations, including children, pregnant women, people with disabilities, female-headed households, migrants, refugees, and marginalized ethnic and religious groups.</p>\n<p>The Central Bank was unable to defend the currency due to insufficient international reserves, leading to the government defaulting on debt payments in May 2022. Inflation rates rose sharply since the government could not import essential commodities, including fuel, which further increased shortages and inflation. Inflation rates slowly dropped, with food inflation (Year-over-year) decreasing from 30.6 per cent in April 2023 to 21.5 per cent in May 2023, while non-food inflation (Year-over-year) decreased from 37.6 per cent in April 2023 to 27.0 per cent in May 2023.4</p>\n<p>The emerging crisis led to country-wide civil unrest. Following mass protests, which started in March 2022, a new government was installed in May, and the country’s president was replaced in July. To help ensure support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the new government raised taxes to offset the external debt, adding to the economic burden, including that faced by the most vulnerable. On 20 March 2023, the IMF Board approved a 48month extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility of SDR 2.286 billion (about USD 3 billion) to support Sri Lanka’s economic policies and reforms. The fiscal macroeconomic crisis resulted in a humanitarian emergency during the fourth quarter of the year 2022, causing millions of people to face widespread and chronic food, fuel, cooking gas and health services shortages. Unprecedented food inflation increased food insecurity, particularly among children under five, pregnant women, and lactating mothers. The poverty rate accelerated since the crisis began, with food inflation reaching a record high of 94.9 per cent in September 2022. Sri Lanka was ranked as having the world's sixth-highest food inflation.5</p>\n<p>Humanitarian support for these groups decreased, making them even more vulnerable. Food insecurity had also made them vulnerable, including informal wage earners, minimum wage earners, single female-headed households, families with multiple children, low-income households, chronic illnesses, and disadvantaged farmers. Outbound migration is increasing still, affecting skilled labor retention, and putting children of absent parents at risk of neglect.</p>\n<p>By 2024, Sri Lanka had made notable progress in stabilizing its economy and reform process, with economic growth beginning to recover after two years of contraction. Despite these gains, the overall recovery remains uneven. Many households, particularly those already vulnerable, continue to face heightened hardships, with poverty still nearly double pre-crisis levels, food insecurity persisting, and ongoing concerns around malnutrition, limited livelihood opportunities, and reduced access to essential services6.</p>\n              \n      \n      ",

The reinsurance industry report notes that although modeling wildfire risk is complex, it is clear that loss potential is growing. The stark picture presented by the report – data, trends, and discussion of underlying causes – made me reflect on my own experience.</p>\n<p>In 1997–98, during one of the most severe El Niño events of the twentieth century, Indonesia experienced unprecedented wildfires. Nearly 10 million hectares of forest were burned – a land area larger than Austria or South Korea. The estimated economic losses were a staggering USD 17.8–19.6 billion in today’s terms. The fires burned the peatlands – natural carbon stores – and released vast amounts of CO2. Dense haze affected not only Indonesia but also much of Southeast Asia.</p>\n<p>In response, affected countries came together and developed the ASEAN Haze Action Plan, with countries contributing specific technical capacities and taking responsibility for various aspects of wildfire prediction, prevention, and response.</p>\n<p>In the aftermath of these fires, representing the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center, I joined a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://unhabitat.org/\">UN-Habitat</a>-led <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://staging.unhabitat.org/pmss/listItemDetails.aspx?publicationID=1861\">inter-agency study</a> to understand the causes of the forest fires and their impacts on human settlements. The fieldwork, and particularly the interactions I had with communities in East Kalimantan, has stayed with me.</p>\n<p>Gentle reader,</p>\n<p>Given the seriousness, complexity and scope of this issue, I cannot possibly present a definitive guide to effective wildfire risk management in this short article. Rather, I offer the ten fundamentals of wildfire risk management that I have learned from my experiences over the years:</p>\n<h2>1. Prevention <em>is</em> the cure</h2>\n<p>In disaster risk management, they say “prevention is better than cure” – however, for wildfires, prevention <strong>is</strong> the cure. While we must improve fire suppression capacities, we know that even countries with the most advanced firefighting capacities find it difficult to contain a wildfire once fully underway. Countries that invest in fire <strong>prevention</strong> see a marked decrease in fire prevalence and damage. For example, Portugal’s post-2017 <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.agif.pt/en/action/national-plan-for-integrated-wildland-fire-management\">national wildfire management plan</a> shifted the focus to prevention, and subsequent years saw a significant decline in burned areas, even in the severe fire season of 2025.</p>\n<h2>2. Fire is not inherently bad</h2>\n<p>After all, in forested wildlands, controlled burning has been used as a forest management strategy for millennia. It can be used to clear the undergrowth and remove the fuel (e.g. dry leaves and wood) from the forest floor in order to prevent or slow large fires. However, such burns need to be carried out with care, as controlled fires too often get out of control to become destructive wildfires. It is important that controlled (or prescribed) burning brings to bear a combination of indigenous knowledge, modern forest management practices, and methods of forecasting fire susceptibility.</p>\n<h2>3. Sustainable management of wildlands is foundational</h2>\n<p>Effective wildfire risk management rests on sound and sustainable management of wildlands. In forested wildlands, this involves strong partnerships between forest managers, local communities, and private sector stakeholders. Good governance of forests – clarity of ownership, transparency in legitimate rights to forest resources, landscape level planning, and strategic vision for management of forest resources – is essential. The legal and customary rights of communities to profit from the forests – for example, by accessing non-timber forest produce such as medicinal plants, plant resins and fruits – contribute to a greater sense of ownership and participation in effective fire risk management.</p>\n<h2>4. Communities need to be principal actors in wildfire risk management</h2>\n<p>In many regions, communities have lived in and around wildlands for centuries, evolving a system of custodianship and conservation through regulated exploitation. Wildlands may support overlapping ecologically viable uses by multiple stakeholders. In forested wildlands, for example, a government forestry department may sustainably harvest timber, while local communities may harvest non-timber products like resins, mushrooms, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://iforest.global/report/forest-fires-and-tendu-leaf-collection-in-india-an-evidence-based-analysis/\">leaves</a>, ferns, nuts, or maple syrup. If such overlapping uses are clearly defined and equitably administered, communities have a stronger incentive to steward the land, reduce fire risks, and act as first responders.</p>\n<h2>5. Local capacity for wildfire suppression is of paramount importance</h2>\n<p>Local capacities such as provision of access to local water sources, firefighting equipment, locally trained firefighters, and trained volunteer groups are critical for an effective fire response, especially for the all-important initial intervention. Locally based systems are agile and can respond quickly, so they stand the best chance of containing a fire before it spreads – this means they are often as important as more advanced technologies like aerial firefighting systems.</p>\n<h2>6. Wildfires differ from ecosystem to ecosystem</h2>\n<p>In some types of wildlands, the fires may be largely crown fires. In other types, the fires may affect the undergrowth more than the trees. In grassy plains fires may burn relatively cool, but spread over vast distances at great speed. Some Australian eucalypts can <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339614283_Drivers_of_long-distance_spotting_during_wildfires_in_south-eastern_Australia\">disperse windborne firebrands</a>, igniting new fire fronts far from the initial blaze. Each type of fire needs its own unique approach for prevention and suppression. In any wildfire risk management system, knowledge and expertise on the specific ecosystems themselves becomes of central importance.</p>\n<h2>7. The impact of wildfire is often underestimated</h2>\n<p>The impact of wildfires is often presented in the form of area burnt or the financial value of assets lost. When wildfires affect high-value areas these financial costs can make the disasters amongst the most expensive, such as the fires that tore through parts of Los Angeles in January 2025, causing the most expensive event of the year for insurers. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.undrr.org/news/invisible-costs-wildfire-disasters-2025\">But the true impact can be even more devastating</a> and is often underestimated because non-economic losses such as loss of biodiversity, disruption of eco-system services, and impact on public health are often not taken into account.</p>\n<h2>8. We can “build back better” after wildfires</h2>\n<p>The notion of “build back better” after earthquakes and cyclones is an accepted key guiding principle of post-disaster recovery. It largely applies to making the built environment more resilient and strengthening livelihood systems. That same intentionality is needed for recovery after wildfires. How do we address the loss of old-growth forests? How do we plan ecological restoration to enable resilience to future hazards and restore ecosystem functions such as wildlife habitat or economically and culturally important ecosystem services for local communities? This requires careful planning, sustained investment and long-term community participation.</p>\n<h2>9. The promise of technology is underutilized</h2>\n<p>Advancements in remote sensing, and the growing application of AI make it possible to detect forest fires as well as issue danger alerts or early warnings based on temperature, humidity, wind, and fuel conditions. However, these technologies cannot be applied in isolation. Remote observations must be corroborated and complemented by ground observations to develop location-specific fire danger alert systems. Equally important are feedback mechanisms to assess whether alerts are understood and acted upon by communities and local officials. Systems such as the GEO-led <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://earthobservations.org/about-us/news/how-we-re-building-a-common-reference-for-understanding-wildfires\">Global Wildfire Information System (GWIS)</a> demonstrate this comprehensive approach and need adoption at scale.</p>\n<h2>10. We must increase investment in wildfire risk management</h2>\n<p>Greater public awareness of the economic, social, cultural and ecological value of forests and wildlands can help create a stronger social demand for wildfire prevention, and make a robust public policy case for much greater investment in all aspects of wildfire risk management. These investments must cover the full risk management cycle – real time information management, risk reduction, seasonal preparedness, response capacities, and resilient recovery. It is important that the entire spectrum of needs is resourced, as underinvestment in any one area weakens the whole system.</p>\n<p>As the Munich Re report points out, wildfires are no longer isolated episodes. Wildfire risk – and the associated loss potential – is increasing, and as we develop new solutions, whether in financial risk management or in technological advances for fire prevention, detection, and suppression, it is essential that we do not lose sight of the ten fundamentals outlined above.</p>\n              \n      \n      ",

According to the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis, 784,000 people were classified in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency) and nearly 3.8 million in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis), marking a significant increase from earlier projections. Acute malnutrition also rose sharply, with 1.8 million children under five requiring urgent treatment. These worsening indicators underscored the profound impact of prolonged drought, conflict, and economic instability, compounded by major reductions in humanitarian funding.</p>\n<p>As of 5 August 2025, UNOCHA reported severe drought conditions across multiple regions, particularly Mudug, Nugaal, Bari, Awdal, Woqooyi Galbeed, and Sanaag. Approximately 2.5 million people were living in areas classified as moderately or severely affected across 26 districts, including 887,000 people in severely affected areas across 16 districts. Five districts—Zeylac, Lughaye, Bossaso, Galkacyo, and Hobyo—were recently reprioritized by the Humanitarian Country Team to align with ongoing programmes following substantial funding cuts.</p>\n<p>In Somaliland, consecutive failed Gu and Deyr rainy seasons resulted in one of the worst droughts in recent years, leading to widespread depletion of water sources, crop failure, and livestock deaths among pastoral and agro-pastoral communities. The National Disaster Preparedness and Food Reserve Authority (NADFOR) estimated that 810,000 people were critically affected, with projections suggesting the number could rise to 1.2 million if conditions persisted. In response, the President declared a drought emergency on 22 July 2025, followed by the establishment of a 15-member National Drought Response Committee on 23 July 2025, chaired by the Vice President to coordinate relief efforts and mobilize resources alongside government ministries, local authorities, humanitarian partners, and international agencies.</p>\n<p>In Puntland, the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management (MoHADM) issued an urgent humanitarian appeal on 31 July 2025 in response to the escalating drought crisis. Failed Gu and Deyr rains led to severe depletion of pasture, food stocks, and water sources, placing millions at risk of hunger and thirst. More than 800,000 people across Puntland were reported to be experiencing acute shortages of water and food, with conditions worsening daily.</p>\n              \n      \n      ",

      "description": "\n                            <div class=\"tag country\">Country: World</div>\n                                      <div class=\"tag source\">Source: International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies</div>\n                                                                                              <p><strong>Kuala Lumpur, 29 January 2026:</strong> As we conclude our Annual Regional Strategic Coordination Meeting in Kuala Lumpur, one message is unmistakably clear: solidarity across our Red Cross and Red Crescent network has never been more vital. Asia Pacific is the most disaster-affected region in the world. Communities across the region are facing more frequent and severe floods, cyclones and heatwaves, rising displacement, and overlapping vulnerabilities. At the same time, humanitarian needs are growing while funding continues to shrink. This widening gap between needs and resources is placing unprecedented pressure on local responders and the communities they serve.</p>\n<p>Over the past three days, Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies came together to reflect on these realities and look ahead. We discussed regional risks, emerging humanitarian needs, and shared priorities for the year to come. We examined how local Red Cross Red Crescent Societies can better prepare and respond to disasters, how the climate crisis impacts are reshaping humanitarian action, and how Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies are increasingly leading responses both at home and in support of sister organisations in other countries.</p>\n<p>What emerged clearly from these discussions was a shared understanding that no single organisation can meet today’s humanitarian challenges alone: National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies must deepen cooperation within our own global network, while also working closely with like-minded partners. Solidarity: practical, operational, and financial, is the foundation of our collective strength. Helping your neighbours is not humanitarianism; it’s a basic decency. Humanitarianism is helping strangers. That spirit of mutual support across borders defines the Red Cross and Red Crescent, and it will sustain us in the years ahead.</p>\n<p>Despite mounting pressures, the IFRC network remains committed to being local, everywhere. In many crises, Red Cross and Red Crescent volunteers and staff are among the first to respond and the last to leave. Increasingly, they are the only humanitarians still present as others scale down. This reality demands that we work smarter, coordinate better, and ensure limited resources are used where they can have the greatest impact.</p>\n<p>The <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ifrc.org/who-we-are/about-ifrc/global-plan\">IFRC’s Global Plan for 2026</a> reflects this approach. With a funding requirement of 3.4 billion Swiss francs, it prioritises locally led action, strengthens National Society leadership, and channels most internationally mobilised resources to the national level. Investment in local capacity is not only more cost-effective — it is essential for sustainable humanitarian response.</p>\n<p>What gives me hope is the strength of this region’s National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. Several National Societies that once received international assistance are now leading responses in their own countries and supporting neighbours across borders. This solidarity extends beyond the region, with long-standing partner National Societies continuing to show true comradeship by standing with sister organizations when they need to support most. This is humanitarianism at its best — not saviourism, but shared purpose, grounded in dignity, mutual support and respect for local leadership.</p>\n<p>As we conclude this meeting, we do so with renewed determination. The challenges ahead are immense, but so is the collective strength of our Red Cross and Red Crescent family. In a time of shrinking resources and growing humanitarian needs, solidarity is not just a commitment — it is how we will continue to deliver for communities across Asia Pacific. We call on like-minded partners to stand with us in this shared endeavour, so that assistance continues to reach those who need it most.</p>\n<p><strong>Alexander Matheou, IFRC Regional Director for Asia Pacific.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>For more information or to request an interview, please contact:</strong> <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ifrc.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9df0f8f9f4fcddf4fbeffeb3f2effa\"><strong>[email protected]</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>In Kuala Lumpur: Afrhill Rances</strong> +60 19 271 3641</p>\n              \n      \n      ",

Over 690,000 people have been affected, with numbers expected to rise as rains continue in Mozambique and floodwater persists. Gaza is the most affected province. Evacuations are ongoing amid significant risks to health facilities, schools and critical infrastructure2.</p>\n<p>On 16th January, the Government of Mozambique (GoM) declared a nationwide Red Alert and scaled up emergency response measures. On January 22nd, the President of the Republic indicated to establish the Emergency Operations Room at the Presidency, with the aim of ensuring continuous monitoring of the disaster Mozambique is facing, as a result of heavy rains, floods, and overflowing rivers affecting the southern and central regions.</p>\n<p>According to the Minsitry of Agriculture, environment and fisheries (MAAP), as per 26 January more than 244,000 farmers have been impacted with standing crops washed away and key productive assets lost across crops, livestock and fisheries. Significant livestock deaths and overcrowding of surviving herds are increasing disease risk, raising the likelihood of prolonged acute food insecurity without timely support.</p>\n<p>As of 27th January 2026 a total of 111 Accomodation Centres (ACs) were opened, with +101,000 people displaced, where food, WASH, health, logistics and protection services are the priorities.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenges impeding response:</strong> Access is becoming a major issue as the main national road (EN1) is flooded and the water levels are rising, especially in the Gaza province. The city of Xai-Xai, which is the capital of Gaza province, is inundated and cut off from the southern part of the country, with very limited movement possible due to floods. This delays assistance and rescue missions on the ground. The limited number of operational FSL actors in the southern part of the country has also been a challenge for the first few days of the response. Partners are progressively mobilizing and deploying to respond to the new needs in this region, while keeping the response in the conflict affected areas of the north.</p>\n<p><strong>Main needs and gaps to be filled:</strong> Additional funding is urgently required to provide life saving food assistance and life saving agriculture and livelihood to the most affected populations.</p>\n              \n      \n      ",

The Disaster Preparedness and Resilience Development Policy Loan with a Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (Cat DDO) will enable the government to better manage the fiscal and social impact of disasters by allowing it to quickly mobilize resources, facilitating emergency response and resilient recovery.</p>\n<p>Croatia faces significant risks from earthquakes, floods, landslides, heatwaves, droughts, and wildfires. Average annual economic losses are estimated at about 0.8% of GDP, while the 2020 earthquakes resulted in damages and losses of around €16.1 billion—approximately 24% of GDP. Strengthening financial and social protection measures is essential to safeguard lives, jobs, and recent economic gains.</p>\n<p>This is Croatia’s first Cat DDO. The reform program will help reinforce Croatia’s disaster preparedness and resilience by enhancing institutional capacity and increasing financial resilience across three pillars. First, through national reforms to strengthen infrastructure management and institutional capacity for adaptation. Second, through reforms in strategic sectors—including energy, tourism, and housing—toboost renewable self-supply of electricity, scale resilient tourism investments, and increase safety-focused upgrades in multi-apartment buildings. And third, through measures to encourage disaster insurance uptake and provide recovery support for vulnerable populations.</p>\n<p>“<em>This €100 million loan marks a significant milestone in Croatia’s ongoing efforts to enhance our disaster preparedness and resilience. It provides us with critical tools to better manage the fiscal impacts of natural disasters and to respond swiftly and effectively when emergencies occur. By strengthening institutional capacity, upgrading infrastructure, and promoting financial protection measures, we are dedicated to ensuring the safety of our population, supporting the resilience of livelihoods, and maintaining the progress of our economic development</em>,” highlighted <strong>Marko Primorac, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>“This project helps strengthen Croatia’s ability to respond to emergencies while building the resilience needed to protect lives, jobs, and development gains,”</em> said <strong>Anna Akhalkatsi, World Bank Division Director for the European Union</strong>. “<em>It supports the government’s efforts to build a safer and more equitable country, with institutions better prepared to manage risks and safeguard people’s well-being.</em>”</p>\n<p>The Cat DDO has a three-year loan duration and provides contingent financing to complement budget reserve allocations, serving as a source of immediate liquidity and bridge financing while other funds are mobilized following a natural disaster. The Cat DDO forms part of World Bank’s Crisis Preparedness and Response Toolkit, providing predictable contingency funds for eligible emergencies, and operationalizing one of the key priority areas under the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/croatia/publication/croatia-country-partnership-framework-for-2025-2030\">Country Partnership Framework for Croatia for FY25–FY30</a>.</p>\n<p>Through the Crisis Toolkit, Croatia will also have access to the Rapid Response Option. This instrument allows countries to quickly repurpose up to 10% of undisbursed funds from existing World Bank-financed projects, providing additional fast, flexible financing for urgent needs while longer-term recovery is put in place.</p>\n<p><strong>PRESS RELEASE NO: 2026/ECA/036</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Contacts</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>World Bank</strong></p>\n<p>Vanja Frajtić</p>\n<p>vfrajtic@worldbank.org</p>\n<p><strong>Ministry of Finance</strong></p>\n<p>Sanja Bach</p>\n<p>glasnogovornica@mfin.hr</p>\n              \n      \n      ",

As of 21 January, US$4.73 million has been received and US$1 million pledged, leaving a funding gap of US$2.1 million.</li>\n</ul><p><strong>Situation Overview &amp; Humanitarian Needs</strong></p>\n<p>Cyclone Ditwah made landfall on the East coast of Sri Lanka on 28 November 2025, causing widespread floods and deadly landslides across the nation. Some 646 people are reported to have died, while 173 people remain missing. According to the Humanitarian Priorities Plans (HPP), over 2.2 million people were affected and an estimated 1.2 million people are in need of assistance, including almost 527,000 children.<br>\nWhile displacement figures are declining, 8,294 people remain in 113 safety centers and 169,642 are staying with host families or renting accommodation. Many cannot return home due to severe housing damage, ongoing monsoon rains and landslide risks, and relocation needs for families in high-risk zones. Economic vulnerability further delays recovery for thousands of households.</p>\n<p>Weather conditions in the North and East remain unsettled. Rainfall has continued between 8 and 12 January, with the low depression zone developed near Sri Lanka increasing the fears of a second tropical disturbance. However, the overall rainfall was moderate and lower than predicted. Most irrigation tanks are now at full capacity, raising concerns about potential overflow if heavy rains return.</p>\n<p>Findings from the Joint Rapid Needs Assessment – Phase II, conducted by the Government in collaboration with humanitarian partners in December, underscored significant sectoral impacts and priority areas for response.</p>\n<p>The rapid Education Sector needs assessment found that learning for over 890,000 children was disrupted by the cyclone, exceeding earlier estimations included in the Humanitarian Priorities Plan (HPP). A total of 1,682 primary and secondary schools were affected, impacting 822,751 children, along with 2,700 pre-primary schools affecting 68,000 children. The assessment further finds that 15 to 20 per cent of schools sustained structural damage. Beyond infrastructure loss, thousands of children have lost essential learning materials, and prolonged displacement has disrupted learning routines. Teachers face challenges due to damaged transport networks and overcrowded host schools, while system-level strains include inadequate facilities and heightened psychosocial needs among students and staff.</p>\n<p>These findings are complemented by results from RAPIDA (Rapid Assessment of Priority Interventions for Early Recovery), a qualitative assessment led by the Disaster Management Centre in collaboration with UNDP and partners, which highlighted widespread, interconnected impacts on housing, infrastructure, livelihoods, essential services, and the environment. Key informants report that while initial response, repairs, and debris clearance have begun, recovery efforts remain constrained by material shortages, limited technical and financial capacity, environmental degradation, and climate risks. Some 31 per cent of key informants identified access to clean water as a key long-term environmental concern, while 22 per cent highlighted risks of disease outbreaks. The Government of Sri Lanka has begun developing a Recovery Plan and is preparing for a Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA). UNICEF is actively engaged in the PDNA process, leading the Education and WASH chapters, and contributing sectoral expertise and data for Nutrition and Protection. Meanwhile, urgent humanitarian needs remain.</p>\n              \n      \n      ",

Desde su apertura en 2022, NRC asistió a más de 29.000 personas afectadas por violencia y movilidad forzada, incluidas familias desplazadas internas, personas migrantes y deportadas, y menores fuera del sistema educativo. Sus programas apoyaron a organizaciones locales que brindan albergue, atención en salud mental y servicios para sobrevivientes de violencia de género. El crimen organizado, la pobreza, la inseguridad alimentaria y desastres recurrentes han desplazado a unas 1,2 millones de personas a nivel nacional, mientras persisten necesidades de protección pese a la reducción de los movimientos hacia el norte.</p>\n<p><strong>PERÚ: RIESGO DE INUNDACIONES</strong></p>\n<p>El 15 de enero, el Comité Multisectorial para el Estudio Nacional del Fenómeno El Niño elevó la alerta nacional por un El Niño Costero, ante la creciente probabilidad de condiciones cálidas débiles a lo largo de la costa entre abril y al menos octubre. El Comité identificó marzo como un periodo de transición de alto riesgo y advirtió que incluso un evento débil puede generar impactos significativos. El aumento de la temperatura superficial del mar frente al norte de Perú y Ecuador incrementa el riesgo de lluvias por encima de lo normal, inundaciones, deslizamientos y dengue. Las autoridades prevén caudales mayormente normales, pero señalan riesgo elevado de crecidas súbitas en valles costeros y zonas altas. Eventos de El Niño Costero en 2017 y 2023 causaron daños generalizados, y la reconstrucción sigue incompleta en varias ciudades expuestas.</p>\n<p><strong>COLOMBIA: ACCESO HUMANITARIO</strong></p>\n<p>Entre enero y diciembre de 2025, Colombia registró 416 restricciones de acceso humanitario, un aumento del 13 por ciento frente a 2024. Se documentaron 375 barreras y 120 incidentes, que afectaron a unas 1,6 millones de personas en 25 departamentos. Cauca, Chocó, Norte de Santander, Valle del Cauca y Bolívar concentraron la mayor proporción de eventos. La tendencia se mantuvo similar a la del primer semestre, salvo en Bolívar, donde los toques de queda armados en julio y diciembre impulsaron el aumento. Las restricciones afectaron a 202 municipios, un 85 por ciento más que en 2024, con mayor impacto en Buenaventura, Tibú, Santa Rosa del Sur y Tierralta. Más de la mitad de los incidentes limitaron el acceso de la población civil a servicios y asistencia, mientras amenazas, violencia y hostilidades restringieron las operaciones humanitarias.</p>\n<p><strong>CHILE: INCENDIOS</strong></p>\n<p>El calor extremo y los fuertes vientos siguen impulsando incendios forestales en el centro-sur de Chile, con focos activos en Biobío, Ñuble y La Araucanía. Al 23 de enero, las autoridades reportaron 21 personas fallecidas, más de 20.000 afectadas, más de 50.000 evacuadas y al menos 2.300 viviendas destruidas. Los incendios han quemado más de 64.000 hectáreas a nivel nacional y han interrumpido servicios de salud, educación y agua. Socios internacionales desplegaron brigadas de México y Uruguay, aportaron equipamiento desde Estados Unidos y comprometieron US$250.000 del Banco de Desarrollo de América Latina y el Caribe. Redes del sector privado apoyan evaluaciones de daños y recuperación temprana. El Gobierno mantiene el estado de catástrofe.

Since opening in 2022, NRC assisted more than 29,000 people affected by violence and forced mobility, including internally displaced families, migrants, deportees, and children out of school. Its programmes also supported local organisations delivering shelter, mental health care, and services for survivors of gender-based violence. Organised crime, poverty, food insecurity, and recurrent floods and landslides have displaced an estimated 1.2 million people nationwide, while protection needs persist despite declining northbound movements.</p>\n<p><strong>PERU: FLOOD RISK</strong></p>\n<p>On 15 January, Peru’s Multisectoral Committee for the National Study of El Niño raised the national alert for a Coastal El Niño, citing a growing likelihood of weak warm conditions along the coast from April through at least October. The Committee identified March as a high-risk transition period and warned that even a weak event can cause significant impacts. Rising sea surface temperatures along northern Peru and Ecuador increase the risk of above-normal rainfall, flooding, landslides, and dengue. Authorities expect mostly normal river flows but note elevated flash flood risk in coastal valleys and upland zones. Past Coastal El Niño events in 2017 and 2023 caused widespread damage, and reconstruction remains incomplete in several exposed cities.</p>\n<p><strong>COLOMBIA: HUMANITARIAN ACCESS</strong></p>\n<p>Between January and December 2025, Colombia recorded 416 humanitarian access restrictions, a 13 per cent increase from 2024. These included 375 barriers and 120 documented incidents, affecting an estimated 1.6 million people across 25 provinces. Cauca, Chocó, Norte de Santander, Valle del Cauca, and Bolívar reported the highest shares of events. Trends largely mirrored the first half of the year, except in Bolívar, where armed curfews in July and December drove an increase. Restrictions affected 202 municipalities, an 85 per cent rise from 2024, with the most severe impacts in Buenaventura, Tibú, Santa Rosa del Sur, and Tierralta. More than half of incidents restricted civilian access to services and assistance, while threats, violence, and ongoing hostilities limited humanitarian operations.</p>\n<p><strong>CHILE: WILDFIRES</strong></p>\n<p>Extreme heat and strong winds continue to drive wildfires across south-central Chile, with active fires in Biobío, Ñuble, and La Araucanía. As of 23 January, authorities reported 21 deaths, more than 20,000 people affected, over 50,000 evacuated, and at least 2,300 homes destroyed. Fires have burned more than 64,000 hectares nationwide and disrupted health facilities, schools, and water services. International partners have deployed firefighting brigades from Mexico and Uruguay, provided equipment from the United States, and committed US$250,000 from the Development Bank of Latin America and the Caribbean. Private sector networks support damage assessments and early recovery. The Government maintains a state of catastrophe. The UN activated its emergency response group to support national efforts.</p>\n              \n      \n      ",

While ceasefire agreements and subsequent extensions, including a 15-day extension announced on 24 January, have contributed to a relative decrease in active tensions in some areas, the situation remains fragile with localized security incidents and population movements continuing to be reported.</p>\n<p>The recent developments triggered large-scale displacement during the first half of January, followed by secondary and onward movements toward eastern governorates, particularly Al-Hasakeh. Although some return movements have been observed following the ceasefire, many displaced families remain unable to return due to prevailing safety concerns of explosive ordnance contamination, damaged infrastructure, and limited access to basic services.</p>\n<p>Displacement remains significant. As of 25 January 2026, more than 170,000 internally displaced persons were recorded by the IDP Task Force across 178 communities in 27 sub-districts in Aleppo, Al-Hasakeh, and Ar-Raqqa governorates, complicating tracking, coordination, and the delivery of assistance. Displacement patterns indicate a strong concentration in Qamishli District, hosting an estimated 97,900 IDPs, followed by Al-Malikiyyeh District with approximately 32,000 IDPs.</p>\n<p>The displaced population is predominantly composed of women, girls, and boys combined, who together represent approximately 91 per cent of displaced persons and are disproportionately exposed to protection risks, resulting in heightened needs for health, nutrition, shelter, education, and psychosocial support.</p>\n<p>In Al-Hasakeh governorate, onward movements from Ar-Raqqa and Tabqa, alongside pre-emptive displacement from parts of Al-Hasakeh city toward surrounding areas, have been observed amid heightened security concerns.</p>\n<p>Approximately 74 per cent of displaced households are being accommodated by host communities, placing substantial additional pressure on already overstretched local services, housing, water systems, and livelihoods, while camps and collective shelters continue to absorb new arrivals and experience congestion.</p>\n<p>The Government announced the opening of two humanitarian corridors along the Ar-Raqqa–Al-Hasakeh road near Tall Dawood village, the Ain al-Arab junction on the M4 highway, Through these routes, three inter-agency humanitarian convoys were facilitated between 25 and 27 January, including two humanitarian convoys, of 24 trucks and five trucks respectively to Kobani (Ain al Arab), and a subsequent 30 truck convoy to Qamishli, delivering multi-sectoral life-saving assistance such as food, medicine, nutrition supplies, non-food items, health and WASH supplies, winterization support, protection items, and fuel to support the restoration of water supply systems. Despite these measures, access continues to vary depending on operational conditions and route availability. More humanitarian assistance convoys are planned to both Ain Al Arab (Kobani) and Qamshili in the coming days.</p>\n<p>Winter conditions, including episodes of heavy snowfall and low temperatures, have further compounded humanitarian needs for displaced populations, particularly those living in overcrowded or non-winterized shelters.</p>\n              \n      \n      ",

The impact of insecurity is compounded by a worsening cholera outbreak, further heightening risks to affected communities. Security conditions in northern and central Jonglei remain volatile, with ongoing clashes between the South Sudan People’s Defence Forces (SSPDF) and the Sudan People’s Liberation Army in Opposition (SPLA-iO), as well as reports of aerial bombardment. Insecurity is increasingly affecting civilians and disrupting humanitarian operations, raising protection concerns and operational risks for aid workers.</p>\n<p>On 28 January, clashes broke out in Pathai town, Uror County, as SSPDF forces advanced from Ayod County towards the northern outskirts of Yuai. The fighting followed the movement of SSPDF forces on 27 January amid broader military operations in Uror County. Information on civilian casualties and damage remains limited.</p>\n<p>Displaced families are reportedly sheltering in the open, under trees or in makeshift structures, with limited access to food, health services, safe water, and protection, and are largely dependent on already overstretched host communities. Health facilities have been looted or vandalized, leaving an estimated 115,000 people without access to basic health care in Yuai, Nyirol, and Uror. Meanwhile, critical gaps in health services and supplies have been reported across Duk, Canal/Pigi, Akobo, Ayod, and Fangak, affecting a combined catchment population of over one million people, due to conflict and access constraints. On 25 January, Government forces ordered civilians and personnel from the UN and other humanitarian organizations to evacuate Nyirol, Uror, and Akobo counties within 48 hours ahead of a planned military operation.</p>\n<p>In Duk County, the Commissioner reported that the security situation remains relatively calm; however, humanitarian needs are rising sharply due to the continued arrival of displaced people from Pajut and Uror, escalating cholera transmission, and acute shortages of food and safe water, with only a limited number of boreholes functioning. Displaced families have reportedly not received food assistance since 2 January due to conflict-related disruptions, while new arrivals continue. The Commissioner also noted that conditions in Pajut remain stable, but destruction from fighting on 16 January has prevented returns, with bodies yet to be retrieved, and requested increased humanitarian support and advocacy.</p>\n<p><strong>HUMANITARIAN IMPACT AND NEEDS</strong></p>\n<p>More than 230,000 people have been displaced across Jonglei State following renewed fighting and airstrikes since 29 December 2025, according to the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission (RRC). Insecurity and access constraints have prevented needs assessments in most displacement locations. Displacement includes 105,400 people in Uror, 57,200 inNyirol, 27,000 in Duk, 17,000 in Ayod, 11,000 in Akobo, 8,000 in Twic East, and 4,300 in Bor South counties, placing severe pressure on host communities and basic services. Access to several displacement-affected areas remains constrained. In addition, local authorities report <strong>over</strong> 29,000 arrivals from Jonglei in Mingkaman, Awerial County (Lakes State) as of 28 January.</p>\n<p>Population movements beyond Jonglei continue. As of 23 January, approximately 6,000 people, predominantly women and children, had arrived in Mangalla, Juba County (Central Equatoria). While some displaced families are staying with relatives or host communities, others with greater resources have relocated onward to Juba and surrounding areas. On 29 January, authorities reported new displacement from Jonglei into Ulang County (Upper Nile State) and Pigi County (Jonglei State). In Ulang County, over 13,000 IDPs were verified, including 6,097 in Nyangor, 6,750 in Breach, and 240 in Thullp, while approximately 6,000 people were reportedly displaced from Nyirol to Pigi County. The World Food Programme (WFP) is planning to provide food assistance to IDPs in Ulang County.</p>\n<p>The displacement crisis is being compounded by a rapidly escalating cholera outbreak, particularly in Duk County. As of 25 January, 982 cholera cases and 30 deaths were reported, with treatment centres overwhelmed and critically short of supplies, indicating the need for an immediate shift to full emergency response. An MSF assessment conducted on 28–29 January found a sharp increase in cases since mid-January, including 48 cases and four deaths reported at Poktap Health Care Centre alone. Displaced populations from neighbouring counties are among the most affected.</p>\n<p>There are four cholera treatment centres in Duk County, all facing severe shortages of cholera kits, personal protective equipment (PPE), and infection prevention and control (IPC) materials. At Poktap health facility, a 10-bed cholera treatment centre was accommodating 16 patients, with some patients reportedly treated on the floor. Health workers are reusing IV equipment due to shortages, while WASH support is largely absent. These conditions significantly increase the risk of transmission and mortality.</p>\n<p>Counties including Nyirol and Akobo have recorded some of the highest cholera case fatality rates since the start of the outbreak. However, limited or no access to these areas has severely constrained surveillance, raising concerns about undetected outbreaks and preventable deaths. Based on trends observed in Duk County, similar surges are likely occurring in inaccessible areas. Scaling up case management, emergency supplies, surveillance, WASH interventions, and vaccination is urgently required to prevent further escalation. Between 27 and 30 January, the Acting Humanitarian Coordinator and partners visited Bor County to assess the evolving humanitarian, security, and operational context.</p>\n<p><strong>HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE AND CHALLENGES</strong></p>\n<p>The United Nations and humanitarian partners are scaling up assistance in safer areas, while continuing to advocate for sustained improvements in access. Authorities have reiterated their commitment to address bureaucratic impediments, and the UN and partners continue to call on all parties to facilitate safe, timely, and unhindered humanitarian access to all people in need, in line with international humanitarian law.</p>\n<p>On 26 January, an Initial Rapid Needs Assessment (IRNA) was conducted among people displaced from Jonglei State to Mingkaman, Awerial County (Lakes State), where over 29,000 displaced people have been registered. The assessment identified urgent needs for shelter and non-food items, food assistance, nutrition support, health services,protection, and WASH services. Humanitarian partners are mobilizing resources to respond; however, Awerial County is classified as IPC Phase 4 (Emergency) in the 2025 FSNMS analysis, and food insecurity is expected to worsen as limited resources are shared with newly arrived displaced people.</p>\n<p>On 28 January, the Humanitarian Coordinator for South Sudan, Ms. Anita Kiki Gbeho, met with the Minister of Interior, Hon. Aleu Ayieny Aleu, to strengthen cooperation on addressing security-related challenges affecting humanitarian operations. The Humanitarian Coordinator reaffirmed the UN’s readiness to support government-led efforts to improve security and enable humanitarian action, while the Minister reiterated the Government’s commitment to close collaboration with the United Nations.</p>\n<p>In Duk County, three health facilities, Lost Boys County Hospital, Pajut PHCC, and Koyong PHCC have been removed from the Health Sector Transformation Project (HSTP) due to funding constraints. An international NGO continues to provide nutrition services in Por Chol PHCU, Chol TIM PHCU, and Tiem PHCU, where limited supplies remain available.</p>\n<p>Humanitarian partners remain deeply concerned by worsening access constraints in Jonglei State. Escalating hostilities and large-scale displacement continue to impede humanitarian operations, while flight restrictions are preventing medical evacuations, the delivery of critical health and nutrition supplies, and staff rotations. As of 28 January, flight restrictions have affected humanitarian assistance to an estimated 366,000 people in northern and central Jonglei. Conflict has also disrupted road pre-positioning, while additional constraints on road and river access, looting, damage to facilities, confiscation of vehicles and equipment, and intimidation of aid workers further limit partners’ ability to reach people in need. The Access Working Group is developing an access strategy to secure sustained immediate, safe, and unhindered humanitarian access to all affected and high-risk areas, including locations that remain inaccessible.</p>\n<p><strong>Funding</strong></p>\n<p>On 28 January, the Humanitarian Coordinator for South Sudan, Ms. Anita Kiki Gbeho issued a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Freliefweb.int%2Freport%2Fsouth-sudan%2Fsouth-sudan-central-emergency-response-fund-allocates-10-million-support-conflict-affected-people-jonglei-state&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cdominic.naturukoyo%40un.org%7C016e1b32c9c342be5a7a08de60169e2c%7C0f9e35db544f4f60bdcc5ea416e6dc70%7C0%7C0%7C639053847421146721%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=ddxj8QLgoIFEN3nDSiXgjmGb1d8vfZeAmLHO0pPtkZA%3D&amp;reserved=0\">statement</a> welcoming the approval by the Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC), Mr. Tom Fletcher, of a US$10 million allocation from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to address urgent, life-saving needs arising from escalating violence in Jonglei State.</p>\n<p>The CERF funding will support primary health care, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services, shelter materials and essential non-food items, emergency food assistance through cash-based interventions, and prevention and response services for gender-based violence and violence against children.</p>\n<p>The CERF allocation will be complemented by additional resources from the South Sudan Humanitarian Fund (SSHF) to further scale up the response in areas of greatest need.

Аудит був проведений командою Гуманітарної координації у сфері ГЗН (ГК у сфері ГЗН) з використанням стандартизованого <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/gender-based-violence-risk-assessment-checklist-transit-centers-ukraine-enuk\">Інструменту оцінки ризиків ГЗН</a>. Результати цього звіту будуть представлені на форумах ГК у сфері ГЗН та передані відповідним Кластерам для вжиття необхідних заходів згідно із запропонованими рекомендаціями.</p>\n<p><strong>Результати перевірки</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Загальне середовище та безпека</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Транзитний центр добре освітлений, зокрема ключові зони, такі як спальні, туалети та місця загального користування. У разі перебоїв з електроенергією доступні альтернативні варіанти освітлення.</li>\n<li>Заклад налічує понад 30 спалень на трьох поверхах, що дозволяє окреме розміщення чоловіків, жінок та сімей.</li>\n<li>Гарячі страви та гарячі напої надаються регулярно.</li>\n<li>На момент оцінки переповненості не спостерігалося, а поточна місткість є достатньою для кількості евакуйованих, які там проживають.</li>\n<li>У цій же будівлі розташоване укриття. Його місткість становить приблизно 50 осіб, що є достатнім за поточних умов. Однак, у разі збільшення кількості евакуйованих та надавачів послуг, знадобиться додаткова місткість укриття, а існуюча інфраструктура укриттів потребує вдосконаленого обладнання.</li>\n<li>У разі перебоїв з електропостачанням є генератор.</li>\n<li>Центр не розташований поблизу військових об'єктів, проте близькість до лінії фронту, що змінюється, викликає занепокоєння щодо безпеки.</li>\n<li>Гуманітарні організації , включаючи партнерів ГК у сфері ГЗН, працюють разом у головному приміщенні з чіткими вказівниками та вивісками. Послуги медичної допомоги та психологічної підтримки надаються в окремих спеціально відведених приміщеннях.</li>\n<li>Офіцери Поліції присутні щодня в робочі години (з 9:00 до 17:00). У нічний час на місці залишається адміністративний персонал, який за потреби може викликати поліцію.</li>\n</ul><p><strong>2. Доступ до базових потреб</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Найближчий муніципальний медичний заклад розташований приблизно за 1,5 км від Транзитного центру. Крім того, у місті Запоріжжя функціонують чотири пологові будинки.</li>\n<li>Розповсюдження Наборів гідності є нерегулярним через дефіцит товарів на складі. Гігієнічні набори доступні.</li>\n</ul><p>Відсутні спеціально позначені або відведені місця для грудного вигодовування чи годування дітей. Однак адміністрація надає вільну спальню на запит жінкам, які потребують приватності для грудного вигодовування чи догляду за немовлятами.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Вода, санітарія та гігієна (WASH)</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Питна вода доступна.</li>\n<li>Туалети, розділені за статтю, розташовані на першому поверсі поруч з основними сервісами, при цьому інші туалети та душові кімнати не розділені за статтю; проте всі вони замикаються на ключ.</li>\n<li>Гаряча вода доступна.</li>\n</ul><p><strong>4. Міркування, що стосуються саме ГЗН</strong></p>\n<ul><li>З початку роботи Транзитного центру 20 листопада у грудні було проведено один аудит із безпеки щодо ГЗН. ГК у сфері ГЗН поділиться результатами та рекомендаціями з відповідним кластерам для подальшої роботи та проведе додаткові оцінки за потреби.</li>\n<li>Відсутній офіційний механізм зворотного зв’язку або скарг для евакуйованих. Наразі відгуки можна надавати лише особисто адміністративному персоналу.</li>\n<li>Інформація про запобігання ризикам ГЗН та доступні послуги, включно з превенцією сексуальної експлуатації та насильства (СЕН), розміщена на плакатах, розміщених по всьому Транзитному центру. Партнери ГК у сфері ГЗН мають спеціально відведений стіл з банерами та листівками.</li>\n<li>Не всі співробітники, залучені до управління Транзитним центром, пройшли навчання з питань запобігання та реагування на гендерно зумовлене насильство.</li>\n<li>Впроваджено чіткі механізми повідомлення про ГЗН, а адміністрація та персонал партнерів щодня отримують інформацію про присутність фахівців із ГЗН та шляхи перенаправлення.</li>\n<li>Послуги психосоціальної підтримки (ПСП) легкодоступні.</li>\n<li>Доступні шляхи перенаправлення постраждалих внаслідок ГЗН та правова допомога.</li>\n<li>Медичні працівники, які присутні в Транзитному центрі, навчені та оснащені для роботи з випадками ГЗН.</li>\n</ul><p><strong>Рекомендації</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Забезпечити глибоку обізнаність партнерів із <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/15lu2ufp_fzO_xp0R3OXTqfdPRT49_9T_\">Шляхами перенаправлення постраждалих від ГЗН у надзвичайних ситуаціях для фахівців у сфері ГЗН</a> та <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1hxWXi3nYU4tuVb7RnDmWdZO945dZ8TVy\">Шляхами перенаправлення постраждалих від ГЗН у надзвичайних ситуаціях для суб’єктів, які не є фахівцями у сфері ГЗН</a> в Україні, щоб сприяти своєчасному та належному перенаправленню до спеціалізованих служб у сфері ГЗН.</li>\n<li>Впровадити регулярні аудити із безпеки у сфері ГЗН для систематичної оцінки та усунення змінних ризиків.</li>\n<li>Розширити та урізноманітнити методи поширення інформації про ГЗН (плакати, інформаційні сесії, цифрові канали, як-от QR-коди) для широкої обізнаності про доступні послуги.</li>\n<li>Забезпечити проходження всім персоналом транзитного центру навчання з мінімізації ризиків ГЗН та реагування на них.</li>\n<li>Диверсифікувати та посилити механізми збору скарг і зворотного зв'язку, забезпечивши декілька доступних каналів для евакуйованих осіб.</li>\n<li>Запровадити гендерне розділення всіх туалетів та душових кімнат, із чітким маркуванням та покращеними заходами приватності приміщень.</li>\n<li>Оцінити альтернативи та/або можливості співпраці для забезпечення регулярного постачання Наборів гідності.</li>\n</ul><p>Покращити готовність укриття, включно з оновленням обладнання, та розглянути можливості збільшення його місткості у разі зростання кількості людей.</p>\n              \n      \n      ",

The shelter has a capacity of approximately 50 people, which is sufficient under current conditions. However, in the event of an increase in evacuees and service providers, additional shelter capacity would be required, and existing shelter infrastructure requires improved equipment.</li>\n<li>A generator is available in case of a disruption to the electricity supply.</li>\n<li>The center is not located near military objects however the proximity to the shifting frontline raises security concerns.</li>\n<li>Humanitarian actors operate together in the main room with clear visibility and signage, including GBV AoR partners. Health care and psychological support services are provided from separate designated spaces.</li>\n<li>Police officers are present daily during working hours (09:00–17:00). During nighttime hours, administrative staff remain on site and may contact police if needed.</li>\n</ul><p><strong>2. Access to Basic Needs</strong></p>\n<ul><li>The closest municipal health care facility is located approximately 1.5 km from the Transit Center. Additionally, four maternity hospitals are operational within Zaporizhzhia city.</li>\n<li>Dignity Kit (DK) distribution is irregular due to stock shortages. Hygiene Kits are available.</li>\n<li>There are no designated or marked breastfeeding or feeding spaces. However, the administration provides an empty bedroom upon request for women requiring privacy for breastfeeding or infant care.</li>\n</ul><p><strong>3. Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH)</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Drinking water is available.</li>\n<li>Gender-segregated toilets are available on the first floor near the main services, with Toilets and bathing facilities are not gender-segregated; however, all facilities are lockable</li>\n<li>Hot water is available.</li>\n</ul><p><strong>4. GBV-Specific Considerations</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Since the Transit Center began operating on 20 November, one GBV safety audit has been conducted in December. GBV AoR will share findings with recommendations with relevant clusters for follow-up and will conduct further assessments as needed.</li>\n<li>There is no formal feedback or complaints mechanism for evacuees. Feedback can currently only be provided in person to administrative staff.</li>\n<li>Information on GBV risk prevention and available services, including SEA prevention, is visible through posters displayed around the Transit Center. GBV AoR partners maintain a designated desk with banners and leaflets.</li>\n<li>Not all staff involved in the management of the TC have received GBV prevention and response training.</li>\n<li>Clear GBV reporting mechanisms are in place, with administrative and partner staff informed daily of GBV partner presence and referral processes.</li>\n<li>Psychosocial support (PSS) services are readily available.</li>\n<li>GBV referral pathways and legal aid are available.</li>\n<li>Health care providers present at the TC are trained and equipped to handle GBV cases.</li>\n</ul><p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Ensure that partners are well familiar with the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/15lu2ufp_fzO_xp0R3OXTqfdPRT49_9T_\">Referral Pathway for GBViE cases for GBV partners</a> and the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1hxWXi3nYU4tuVb7RnDmWdZO945dZ8TVy\">Referral Pathway for GBViE cases for non- GBV partners</a> in Ukraine to facilitate timely and appropriate referrals to specialized GBV services.</li>\n<li>Implement regular GBV safety audits to systematically assess and address evolving risks.</li>\n<li>Expand and diversify GBV information dissemination methods, including posters, information sessions, and digital outreach (e.g., QR codes) to ensure widespread awareness of available services.</li>\n<li>Ensure that all transit center staff receive GBV risk mitigation and response training.</li>\n<li>Diversify and strengthen complaint and feedback mechanisms to allow multiple accessible channels for evacuees.</li>\n<li>Implement gender segregation in all toilets and bathing facilities, with clear signage and improved privacy measures.</li>\n<li>Assess alternatives and/or synergies to ensure a regular supply of Dignity Kits.</li>\n<li>Improve bomb shelter preparedness, including equipment upgrades, and assess options for additional shelter capacity in case of increased arrivals.</li>\n</ul>\n              \n      \n      ",

It is important to design studies that explicitly investigate the sexual and reproductive health needs and outcomes of refugee populations, as it is likely that these factors differ among refugee populations as compared to the general population. Understanding the state of abortion in a given context, including abortion incidence, safety, and outcomes, is challenging due to the limitations of currently available methodologies. <em>Objectives</em>: To determine the incidence of induced abortions and the severity of abortion-related complications in refugee settings in Uganda. <em>Methods</em>: The study employed a quantitative cross-sectional design. The study components included three separate surveys. Although the study was not nationally representative, efforts were made to ensure representativeness at the refugee settlement/camp level : i) representative Health Facility Survey (HFS) to estimate the number of women who receive post-abortion care (PAC) following abortion complications, ii) a Knowledgeable Informants Survey (KIS) to capture information on the proportion of all women having abortions who receive facility-based treatment for abortion-related complications, and iv) a Prospective Morbidity Survey (PMS) to capture information necessary to describe characteristics of women receiving treatment for abortion complications, the severity of complications, the type of treatment received, and the delays in access to PAC. The PMS also included clinical data abstraction from the medical records. <em>Potential Impact</em>: This will help host governments, humanitarian partners, and donors to seek long-term, innovative, cost-effective SRHR development solutions to bring about change in the health and lives of refugee women and girls.</p>\n              \n      \n      ",

It is important to design studies that explicitly investigate the sexual and reproductive health needs and outcomes of refugee populations, as it is likely that these factors differ among refugee populations as compared to the general population. Understanding the state of abortion in a given context, including abortion incidence, safety, and outcomes, is challenging due to the limitations of currently available methodologies. <em>Objectives</em>: To determine the incidence of induced abortions and the severity of abortion-related complications in refugee settings in Ethiopia. <em>Methods</em>: The study employed a quantitative cross-sectional design. The study components included three separate surveys. Although the study was not nationally representative, efforts were made to ensure representativeness at the refugee settlement/camp level : i) representative Health Facility Survey (HFS) to estimate the number of women who receive post-abortion care (PAC) following abortion complications, ii) a Knowledgeable Informants Survey (KIS) to capture information on the proportion of all women having abortions who receive facility-based treatment for abortion-related complications, and iv) a Prospective Morbidity Survey (PMS) to capture information necessary to describe characteristics of women receiving treatment for abortion complications, the severity of complications, the type of treatment received, and the delays in access to PAC. The PMS also included clinical data abstraction from the medical records. <em>Potential Impact</em>: This will help host governments, humanitarian partners, and donors to seek long-term, innovative, cost-effective SRHR development solutions to bring about change in the health and lives of refugee women and girls.</p>\n              \n      \n      ",

This study estimated the incidence of induced abortion among women in refugee settings in Ethiopia.</p>\n<h3><strong>Methods</strong></h3>\n<p>This study was conducted in 22 of the 24 refugee camps located in Ethiopia. We used data from a Health Facilities Survey (HFS) of 75 health facilities providing postabortion care (PAC) or safe abortion care (SAC) services within or outside the 22 refugee camps and a Knowledgeable Informant Survey (KIS) of 69 individuals knowledgeable about induced abortion among refugee populations. We estimated the annual postabortion caseload, the number of induced abortions, and the induced abortion rate per 1,000 women of reproductive age.</p>\n<h3><strong>Results</strong></h3>\n<p>We estimated that 9,044 (95% CI: 6,633 − 11,455) women in refugee settings received PAC across the 75 facilities in 2023, while some 2,946 (95% CI: 1,826–4,066) women received SAC. The overall induced abortion incidence rate among women in refugee settings living in camps in Ethiopia was estimated to be 38.3 per 1,000 women aged 15–49 years, with slight variations by region. The proportion of safe abortions obtained from the formal health system was 11.5% in all camps, with a slightly higher proportion of abortions estimated to take place within facilities in Western camps (12.9%) compared to Eastern and Northeastern camps (9.7%).</p>\n<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>\n<p>The study found that abortion incidence is high among women in refugee settings in Ethiopia, and only a small proportion of induced abortions were conducted through SAC services. There is an urgent need to improve family planning, SAC, and PAC services in refugee camps.</p>\n              \n      \n      ",

He and his family of eight joined the camp in December after losing everything to drought.</p>\n<p>“We are living in extremely harsh conditions since we arrived here. Sometimes the family gets food once, given out of compassion by Muslims who see our situation or relatives we call. There is nothing else coming in. No organisation has helped us, and there is no life here. I need food for my children, but I cannot get it,” Ibrahim stated.</p>\n<p>Their last remaining food stocks of sorghum and beans ran out months ago. Ibrahim, 60, says he has little hope of changing his family’s situation as he can’t find labour jobs. His wife is ill and his children are too young to earn income.</p>\n<p>Gawaan camp lacks a borehole, forcing families to rely on water brought from private wells four kilometres away. For Ibrahim, even this option is out of reach as he can’t pay 5,000 Somali shillings for 20 litres of water. They survive on three to five litres begged daily from neighbours.</p>\n<p>“The pressures on us are hunger and thirst. We have no water to use. Life is water and food, and we have neither. There is nothing for children to drink, nothing to cook with, nothing to wash with. We are suffering greatly.”</p>\n<p>Ibrahim says they were displaced from Oflow village in Dinsor district at the beginning of December, after the last one of their 30 remaining goats died.</p>\n<p>Income from farming, once the backbone of his livelihood, had also shrivelled with the drought. In September, he planted grains and vegetables on his four-hectare farm, but the crops all failed due to lack of rain.</p>\n<p>He has debts of $200 that he used to buy seeds, labour, and for land preparation. Displacement has also exposed his children to harsh living conditions:</p>\n<p>“When we lived in our village, we had a proper house. Now we sleep outside because we have no shelter. At night, the cold becomes severe. We huddle together. During the day, there is nowhere to escape the heat.”</p>\n<p>The family walked for two weeks to reach Baidoa after failing to find transport. Ibrahim is worried about three children suffering from high fever, but the camp has no health facility and he can’t afford to seek private medical care.</p>\n<p>Farhiyo Mohamed Mahmoud, who has been a farmer for two decades, was also displaced for the first time last October. She and her 10 children are now living in a makeshift shelter made of cloth and sticks in a camp near Baidoa.</p>\n<p>She walks daily into nearby bushland to collect firewood to sell in town, hoping to earn enough for a single meal. She makes at most $1.5 a day that hardly gets her anywhere.</p>\n<p>“Life has become extremely tight. Our farms failed due to drought, and we came to Baidoa searching for survival. Hunger grips us day and night. Children go hungry for 12 hours. The situation is very bad,” she told Radio Ergo’s local reporter.</p>\n<p>Farhiyo has an eight-month-old baby for whom she can’t buy milk. She says the baby cries through the night from hunger.</p>\n<p>She fled alone after leaving her husband behind in Abay-dhiin, about 60 kilometres away, to look after their seven cows that could not travel the long distance with them. She arrived with nothing, abandoning her home and belongings.</p>\n<p>Debt weighs heavily on her as well: “I owe around four million Somali shillings borrowed for farming. The crops failed, and I could not repay anything. Life and debt are crushing me.”</p>\n<p>The director of the South West State’s Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management ministry, Hussein Noor Aden, said the drought has devastated the region’s main livelihood systems and left more than 621,000 people across the state in perilous living conditions:</p>\n<p>“The immediate problems people face are hunger, water shortage, lack of rainfall, malnutrition, and loss of crops. Out of the 18 districts in South West State, 10 are the worst affected.”</p>\n<p>He said limited water trucking and food distribution had begun, but funding constraints and growing displacement mean assistance falls far short of needs.</p>\n<p>Somalia’s disaster management agency, SODM, also warned that failed Deyr rains and poor Gu seasons have left much of the country facing severe humanitarian conditions.</p>\n<p>As families continue to arrive in camps around Baidoa, food, water, shelter, and health services are urgently needed to prevent the situation from deteriorating further.</p>\n              \n      \n      ",

By providing rapid, pre-arranged financing, REPAIR enables governments to mobilise life-saving assistance immediately after a shock, without waiting for lengthy damage assessments or delayed emergency resource mobilisation.</p>\n<p>The funds will be used to purchase life-saving supplies, including food and medical kits, water storage and sanitation equipment, and emergency shelter and household items.</p>\n<p>Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA) remains one of the world’s most climate-vulnerable regions. In Malawi and Mozambique, the previous two months have been marked by continuous heavy rainfall triggering significant flooding that has claimed at least 115 lives, displaced tens of thousands of people and damaged critical infrastructure across both countries. In Mozambique, the situation was compounded by strong winds, wildfires and a cholera outbreak.</p>\n<p>As participating countries in REPAIR, Malawi and Mozambique subsequently triggered activation requests of USD2.375 million and USD20 million, respectively, to complement their national relief and early recovery operations.</p>\n<p>The Program released the funds within seven (7) business days of both activation requests. Speed is absolutely critical following a natural disaster, which is why REPAIR is committed to disbursing funds rapidly and effectively to its participating countries following shocks.</p>\n<p><em>“In times of crisis, rapid support can make the difference between a shock and a humanitarian emergency,”</em> said David Maslo, CEO of African Risk Capacity (ARC) Ltd., REPAIR’s implementing agency*. “Through REPAIR, ARC Ltd is supporting Malawi and Madagascar in these difficult circumstances by ensuring that critical funding reaches the government quickly, as demonstrated by this disbursement delivered within seven business days of the activation request, so that relief can be mobilised before conditions deteriorate.”*</p>\n<p>According to official figures from the Malawian government, the floods in Nkhotakota District and surrounding areas in late December 2025 directly affected over 49,000 people (approximately 10,900 households), claiming 12 victims and displacing 2,132 families who had to be relocated to temporary camps hosted in schools, churches and a health centre.</p>\n<p>The country’s response to the floods is being coordinated by the Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA), with support from the National Local Government Finance Committee (NLGFC), one of REPAIR’s pre-identified delivery channels. This delivery arrangement supports rapid mobilisation of resources and efficient distribution to affected populations, even in the immediate aftermath of a shock.</p>\n<p>In Mozambique, flooding in the provinces of Maputo, Gaza and Sofala has partially or totally destroyed over 15,000 homes, directly impacting over 231,000 people. The death toll has already reached 112. In addition, 2,145 cases of cholera have been declared in Zambezia and Nampula provinces.</p>\n<p>National relief operations are being led by the National Institute of Disaster Risk Management (INGD), which is working with the National Directorate of Water Supply and Sanitation and Ministry of Health, to deliver food, safe water and sanitation, and medicines to affected populations. These efforts are being hampered by damage to the national highway, the N1, preventing the movement of people and goods up and down the country.</p>\n<p>The rapidity of the fund activations highlights the value of pre-arranged financing instruments designed to ensure that response efforts are not delayed by the mobilisation of emergency resources. By allowing governments to access funds quickly, REPAIR strengthens operational readiness and helps ensure that relief reaches communities when it can make the greatest difference.</p>\n<p>REPAIR is a World Bank program, implemented by ARC Ltd., with financial support from the Global Shield Financing Facility (GSFF).</p>\n<p>These are the Program’s third and fourth disbursements since its creation in July 2024. REPAIR had previously supported relief and recovery efforts in Comoros and Mozambique, following the passage of cyclones Chido and Jude, respectively.</p>\n<p>These activations have allowed participating countries to benefit from each other’s experiences in accessing and delivering funds, while ongoing Simulation Exercises continue to reinforce multi-hazard preparedness and response systems and procedures.</p>\n<p><em>“REPAIR is committed to strengthening not only the financial preparedness of its participating countries, but also their operational readiness. The current activations in Malawi and Mozambique have benefited from the lessons learned last year and from crisis simulation exercises to ensure that Ministries of Finance could promptly activate the program and move the funds swiftly to benefit the affected communities. The peer-to-peer learning between countries is a fundamental feature to create a regional disaster risk finance ecosystem, thereby enhancing the climate resilience of a region which is very susceptible to natural shocks,”</em> explained Caroline Cerruti, World Bank Lead Financial Sector Specialist and REPAIR Regional Lead*. “We thank our participating countries for their active engagement in REPAIR and pledge to stand by their side in times of crisis.”*</p>\n<p>Malawi recently joined REPAIR as part of the programme’s Phase 2, alongside Angola, Burundi, Seychelles and Zambia, while Phase 1 is comprised of Comoros, Madagascar and Mozambique.</p>\n<p>A central component of REPAIR’s approach is the establishment of a Regional Climate Risk Fund, with an envelope of up to USD926 million, designed to increase climate resilience among participating countries by supporting timely and scalable responses to natural shocks based on their severity.</p>\n<p>------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>Press contacts:</strong></p>\n<p>Nicholas Rainer Andry Rasoanindrainy</p>\n<p>REPAIR - Communications Specialist ARC Ltd. - Communications Manager</p>\n<p>nrainer@ltd.arc.int arasoanindrainy@ltd.arc.int</p>\n<p>+230 52570942 +230 545 72 722</p>\n              \n      \n      ",

Above-normal rainfall associated with an active monsoon season and increasingly powerful tropical cyclones drove widespread flooding and landslides, affecting millions of people and straining stretched response capacities. The cumulative impacts of recurrent storms, and seismic activity, underscored the growing complexity of humanitarian needs, particularly in areas facing protracted displacement such as Mindanao. These trends reinforce the urgency of shifting from reactive response toward earlier, risk-informed action. Expanded use of anticipatory action enabled pre-positioning of assistance in several regions, helping mitigate loss of life and livelihoods. Moving forward, strengthening local preparedness, improving forecast-based financing, and aligning government-led systems with humanitarian coordination will be critical to reducing impact in an era of more frequent and severe climate shocks.</p>\n              \n      \n      ",
